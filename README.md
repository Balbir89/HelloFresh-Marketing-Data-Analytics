## Visualizations

This project includes a range of insightful visualizations to help interpret HelloFresh’s marketing performance over the years (2017–2024). Key visual components include:

### Customer Acquisition Cost (CAC) Trends

**Interactive line charts** display CAC variations by region and year, highlighting efficiency improvements and geographic differences.

## A/B Test Simulations & Results

To evaluate the effectiveness of marketing strategies, we performed simulated A/B tests on campaign variations. The simulations demonstrated a meaningful **5% lift in conversion rates** for the new campaign creative compared to the control group, indicating improved customer acquisition.

These tests are based on simulated data reflecting typical campaign durations and sample sizes. While real-world results may vary, this analysis highlights the potential impact of optimized marketing tactics.

*Detailed visualizations and statistical summaries are available in the [Jupyter Notebook](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1DGhh8snDDTjP1ZCZrUx5MMz7OBKF1Jxg#scrollTo=ZrWLBxyZ9Zd3) to support these findings.*

---

## Results & Impact

- CAC decreased by 15% in Europe from 2017 to 2024, indicating improved marketing efficiency.
- Paid Search accounted for 40% of total conversions in 2023, the highest among all channels.
- Simulated A/B testing showed a statistically significant 5% lift in conversions with a new campaign.
- Revenue is forecasted to grow at an average annual rate of 7%, reaching €500M by 2027.

---

## Recommendations / Next Steps

- Increase investment in top-performing channels like Paid Search and Social Media.
- Continue A/B testing new campaign creatives to optimize conversion rates.
- Implement interactive dashboards for real-time monitoring.
- Extend forecasting models with external market indicators.

---

## Future Enhancements

- Incorporate customer lifetime value (LTV) modeling.
- Analyze customer churn and retention metrics.
- Use real-world HelloFresh data if available.
- Automate data pipeline for ongoing analysis.
