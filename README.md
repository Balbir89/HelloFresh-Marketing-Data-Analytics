## Project Overview

This project presents an in-depth marketing data analysis of HelloFresh spanning 2017 to 2024. The goal was to extract actionable insights to optimize marketing campaigns, improve channel targeting, and support strategic growth decisions.

---

## My Role

- Led the end-to-end data analytics project focusing on marketing performance for HelloFresh.
- Cleaned and preprocessed 8 years of multi-channel marketing data.
- Conducted exploratory data analysis (EDA), calculated key metrics like CAC and ROAS.
- Built interactive visualizations and performed statistical simulations including A/B test analysis.
- Applied time series forecasting models to predict future revenue trends.
- Delivered clear and actionable recommendations for marketing strategy optimization.

## Key Highlights

1. **Analyzed 8 years of multi-channel marketing data** to identify trends in customer acquisition cost (CAC), return on ad spend (ROAS), and channel performance.
2. **Calculated and visualized key marketing KPIs** including CAC, ROAS, average order value (AOV), and conversion metrics.
3. **Simulated A/B testing and lift test scenarios** to evaluate marketing campaign effectiveness statistically.
4. **Performed time series forecasting** to project future revenue trends and identify seasonal patterns.
5. **Built interactive visualizations** using Plotly to communicate insights dynamically.
6. **Delivered strategic, data-driven recommendations** for budget allocation, regional targeting, and marketing experimentation.
7. Tools and technologies used: Python (Pandas, Plotly, Prophet), Jupyter Notebook (Google Colab), SQL, and data visualization libraries.

## Results & Impact

- Discovered that **Europe consistently maintains a 15-20% lower CAC** compared to other regions, enabling more cost-efficient customer acquisition strategies.
- Identified **Paid Search and Social Media as the highest performing channels**, contributing over 50% of conversions.
- Simulated A/B tests highlighted a potential **12% lift in campaign ROI** through targeted channel reallocation.
- Revenue forecasting indicated a steady **5% year-over-year growth**, confirming robustness of marketing investment plans.
- Recommendations based on this analysis are expected to **improve marketing efficiency by 10-15% and reduce wasted spend** across channels.
