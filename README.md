## A/B Test Simulations & Results

To evaluate the effectiveness of different marketing strategies, we performed simulated A/B tests on campaign variations. The simulations demonstrated a **5% lift in conversion rates** for the new campaign creative compared to the control group, indicating a statistically significant improvement in customer acquisition.

These tests were based on simulated data reflecting typical campaign durations and sample sizes. While real-world results may vary, the analysis highlights the potential impact of optimized marketing tactics.

*Visualizations and detailed statistical summaries are available in the notebook to support these findings.*


### Time Series Revenue Forecasting:

* Forecast plots using Prophet to project future revenue trends and identify seasonal patterns.

* Revenue forecast incorporating marketing spend as a regressor, showing the impact of advertising on future revenue.
